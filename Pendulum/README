A so-called "simple pendulum" is an idealization of a "real pendulum" but in an isolated system using the following assumptions:
- The rod or cord on which the bob swings is massless, inextensible and always remains taut; 
- The bob is a point mass; 
- Motion occurs only in two dimensions, i.e. the bob does not trace an ellipse but an arc. 
- The motion does not lose energy to friction or air resistance. 
- The gravitational field is uniform. 
- The support does not move.
