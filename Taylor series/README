#Taylor series calculator
It is common practice to approximate a function by using a finite number of terms of its Taylor series. 
Taylor's theorem gives quantitative estimates on the error in this approximation. 
Any finite number of initial terms of the Taylor series of a function is called a Taylor polynomial.

The Taylor series of a real or complex-valued function Æ’(x) that is infinitely differentiable at
a real or complex number a is the power series.
A program to compute sin(x) for given value of x.
